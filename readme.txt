Project Overview: JRPG Game Development

1. Current Status of the Game:

A turn-based JRPG is under development, inspired by classic RPG mechanics.
Multiple components are being implemented, such as exploration, battle, and menus, using modular systems.
Completed or In-Progress Features:

Enemy Data Management: Loading enemy data from a JSON file (e.g., types like goblin, wolf, with attributes such as health, attack_power, etc.).
Random Enemy Selection: Functionality to randomly select enemies from the loaded data and instantiate them during battles.
Basic Enemy Creation: A function create_thing() that initializes enemies with parameters like type, health, and battle points.
Scene & Script Management: Components like create_enemy.gd, enemy_data.gd, and their corresponding scenes have been added to the game.
2. Game Plan:

a. Turn-Based JRPG Battle System:

A battle state machine will manage various phases of combat, such as player input, executing moves, enemy turns, and victory/loss states.
Enemies will be generated based on their attributes dynamically during battles.
b. Exploration System:

A separate state machine will handle non-combat activities like character movement, area transitions, and interactions with the game world.
c. Menus & UI:

A third state machine will control menu navigation (e.g., inventory, skill trees, settings) and player interactions within these menus.
d. Catch-All State Machine:

A fourth state machine is planned to manage additional systems such as cutscenes or other unique game features.
3. Approach to Implementation:

Finite State Machines (FSM):

Modular FSMs will be created for battle, exploration, menus, and other game elements to keep the code well-organized and easily maintainable.
File and Data Management:

Enemy data is loaded from a dedicated script (enemy_data.gd), and the game will continue to expand the use of dynamic data loading for other systems.
Git Integration: Scripts and scenes are tracked via Git. Use branches for different game features (e.g., combat system, UI).
4. Next Steps:

Battle State Machine: Implement the FSM to handle the phases of combat (player turn, enemy turn, etc.).
Exploration System: Create character movement and interaction logic for exploration, controlled via its own FSM.
Menus & UI: Design and implement the menu system, with its own FSM for menu navigation.
Refactoring & Optimization: As the game progresses, refactor the code to keep things modular and manageable.
